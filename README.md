# NLP Text Classification Project using Bidirectional RNN
This project aims to classify text data into different categories using a Bidirectional Recurrent Neural Network (RNN). The goal is to create a model that can accurately predict the category of a given text.

Libraries Used
Pandas
Numpy
Plotly
Regex
SPACY
Keras Word Embedding
Data Preparation
In this project, basic data preparation libraries like Pandas, Numpy and Plotly have been used for cleaning and preprocessing the text data. Text data has been cleaned and preprocessed using Regex, SPACY and Keras Word Embedding.

Model
For text classification, a Bidirectional Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) has been applied. The model has been implemented using the Keras library. The model has been trained using sequence processing RNN models like Bidirectional GRU. Activation functions like SoftMax and ReLU have been used and the ADAM Optimizer has been used to optimize the model.

Results
The model was trained on the given text data and an accuracy of 87% was achieved on the test data.

Conclusion
This project demonstrates the use of Bidirectional RNN for NLP text classification and the importance of preprocessing and cleaning text data for improving the performance of the model.
